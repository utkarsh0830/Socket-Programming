# 🧩 Socket Programming in Python

A comprehensive collection of **socket programming examples** demonstrating real-world **client–server communication**, **TCP/UDP protocols**, and **concurrency handling** using **Python**.  
This repository serves as a hands-on guide for understanding how data travels across networks and how servers interact with multiple clients in real time.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository explores **core networking concepts** through practical implementations.  
Each example is self-contained, well-documented, and focuses on a specific networking scenario — from a simple client-server exchange to more advanced setups like reverse shells and multi-client chat applications.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔹 **TCP Communication:** Reliable, connection-oriented data transfer between client and server  
- 🔹 **UDP Communication:** Lightweight, connectionless message exchange  
- 🔹 **Chat Application:** Real-time multi-client chat system using threading  
- 🔹 **Reverse Shell:** Command execution over socket connection for controlled environments  
- 🔹 **Server Queue Operations:** Handling multiple incoming client requests efficiently  
- 🔹 **Calculation Server:** Performs arithmetic computations through socket-based interaction

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Understand the difference between **TCP** and **UDP** protocols  
- Learn how to implement **multi-threaded servers** to handle concurrent clients  
- Gain insights into **data serialization**, **port management**, and **message framing**  
- Build a foundation for advanced topics like **async I/O**, **WebSockets**, and **network security**
